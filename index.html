    <h1>Why be part of the team?</h1>
    <p>
      <b>OpenToAll</b>'s primary focus is to encourage learning. Here are the <b>core
        values</b> that power <b>OTA</b>.
    </p>

    <h5>We are a learning-oriented community and team that is open to everyone.</h5>
    <p>
      Anyone can join <b>OpenToAll</b>, but you must actively participate
      to stay a member. Don’t get discouraged if you don’t feel you are
      contributing much. <b>Being part of OTA and learning about an area</b>
      IS contributing. You will get there if you stick with it. Don’t give up.
      We only ask that you try your best.
    </p>

    <h5>Show an interest in learning and challenging yourself.</h5>
    <p>
      Being the top team on the scoreboard has no real value.
      Expanding your knowlege and growing your skillset is the only metric
      that really matters.
    </p>

    <h5>Be respectful of other team members.</h5>
    <p>
      Don’t be a dick. Everyone is here to learn, and everyone has deficiencies.
      That’s okay! That’s why we’re all here!
    </p>
